# 🎮 Simon Game

A simple memory game inspired by the classic Simon Game. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📋 How to Play

1. Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2. A colored square will be flashed to indicate the start of *Level 1*. Click/tap the color square that was flashed if you remember it.
3. If you got it correctly, you move to *Level 2*. A new square will be flashed for you. If you remember it, first click/tap the square you tapped in Level 1, then this newest one.
4. As you advance in levels, a new square will be flashed for you each time. You have to remember the order in which you see them and click/tap the squares accordingly.
5. As you click/tap the squares in the correct order, just wait patiently and you will be moved to the next level. You do not need to do anything else.
6. When you lose, you are returned to Level 1. You can start the game again by tapping any key on your keyboard.
